# Recipe Web App Server

Welcome to the server repository of our Recipe Web App! This server is a crucial component of our application, responsible for handling various backend functionalities to provide users with a seamless recipe-sharing experience.

## Features

- **API Endpoints**: Our server exposes a set of API endpoints that allow users to retrieve, create, update, and delete recipes. This forms the backbone of communication between the front-end and the database.

- **User Authentication**: Security is paramount, and our server ensures that only authenticated users can perform certain actions like adding new recipes or leaving comments.

- **Data Management**: The server connects to the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve recipe data, user profiles, and comments. This enables efficient data organization and retrieval for a fast and reliable user experience.


## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The server is built using Node.js, allowing for fast and scalable server-side operations.

- **Express.js**: We utilize the Express.js framework to streamline the creation of API endpoints, making it easier to handle various HTTP requests.

- **PostgreSQL**: Our choice of database is PostgreSQL, which provides powerful relational data storage for recipe data and related information.
